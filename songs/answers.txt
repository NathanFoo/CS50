I would characterize the spotify listener's audio aura as purple and yellow. Mixed with grove and musical impact.

My view is only looks subjective measures of songs. Every person has a different perspective on any given song.
It would not be fit to measure off a subjective basis.
So, I believe the only way to get a true representation of a listener is it to be give by the listener.
For instance getting ratings from the user and be a simple like and dislike button or can be a view of
how long certain songs were played over and over.
